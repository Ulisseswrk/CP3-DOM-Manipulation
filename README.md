# 🛒 Online Product Catalog - DOM Manipulation Project

## Overview

This project is a simple product catalog that allows users to browse, filter, and interact with a list of products dynamically using JavaScript. It was developed as part of a DOM manipulation and data handling exercise.

## 🔧 Technologies & Concepts Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**
  - Arrays and objects to store and manage product data
  - Loops and array methods for data iteration and filtering
  - Event handling (e.g., `click`, `mouseover`)
  - DOM manipulation (creating, modifying, removing elements dynamically)

- **HTML & CSS**
  - Dynamic layout rendering
  - Styling and hover effects to highlight product cards

## 🎯 Features

- **Product Listing**  
  A button that displays all products in the catalog.

- **Filtering System**  
  A form with:
  - A dropdown (`select`) to filter by category
  - A checkbox to show only available products
  - A "Filter" button to apply selected filters

- **Dynamic Product Display**  
  Filtered products are displayed as cards (`<div class="produto">`) on the page.  
  Products highlight visually on hover for better user interaction.

- **Bonus Features (Optional Enhancements):**
  - Group products by category with section headers
  - Add filter options for available/unavailable products
  - Add price sorting functionality (ascending/descending)

## 📊 Functional Diagram

A detailed flowchart diagram is provided in the repository to explain:

- The main components of the system
- Events and their triggers (e.g., button clicks)
- Functions and their responsibilities
- Data flow and DOM updates

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project helps reinforce essential front-end development skills such as:

- Managing and filtering structured data with JavaScript
- Creating interactive web interfaces using DOM APIs
- Applying logic to organize and display information efficiently
